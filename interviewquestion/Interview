Here are REAL, scenario-based Spring Boot interview questions:

1. Your Spring Boot app works locally but fails after deployment. What do you check first?
2. An API is fast locally but very slow in production. How do you debug it?
3. You changed application.properties but nothing changed in prod. Why?
4. Under high traffic, your service crashes even though CPU is low. What’s wrong?
5. Multiple beans of the same type exist and the app fails to start. How do you fix it?
6. You need different configs for dev, test, and prod. How do you design this?
7. APIs randomly return 401 or 403 errors. What could be the reason?
8. Database connection pool suddenly gets exhausted. How do you identify and solve it?
9. One dependent microservice is down and your service also fails. What’s your approach?
10. Application memory usage keeps increasing over time. What do you suspect?
11. @Transactional is present but rollback doesn’t happen. Why?
12. Users still hit old behavior after a new deployment. What went wrong?
13. Logs are missing in production. Where do you start checking?
14. A REST API returns correct data but response time is inconsistent. Why?
15. How do you trace a request across multiple Spring Boot services?
16. You need zero-downtime deployment. How will you achieve it?
17. A background job affects API response time. How do you isolate it?
18. Application behaves differently inside Docker than locally. Why?
19. Lazy loading causes exceptions in production but not locally. Why?
20. What are the most common Spring Boot mistakes that break production?




1. How to implement payment gateway?
2. How to store customer sensitive data like account information in database ?
3. what is @ComponentScan what is the use of it.
4. We have a list of integers. Find out all the numbers starting with 1 using stream function
a. 11, 18, 20, 24, 85, 66, 13
5. We have a list of employees, in which we have id, name, age, gender and salary.
a. How many male and female employees are there in the organization.
b. Take out average salary based on employee gender.
6. Write a java program to find sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers in a given list using java 8 streams.
7. How to find duplicate elements in a given integers list in java using Streams function.
8. I need to compare if two arrays are same, but the order does not matter, just compare the elements in arr1 to elements in arr2
a. arr1 = [3, 2, 5, 7]
b. arr2 = [2, 3, 5, 7]
9. I will provide a string, remove all the occurrences of a given character from that string?
10. Finding special character in the String, special characters are those characters which are not alphabets or not numbers.
11. Write a program to check if given strings are rotations of each other or not
12. Write a program to Find the missing number from the array
13. Write a program to convert first half of the String in lower case and second half in upper case
14. Java 8 Program to get Highest paid Employee in Each department using stream api?
15. Write a java 8 program to find the words starting with vowels
16.Write a java 8 program to print employees count working in each department
17.Write a java 8 program to print active and inactive employees in the given collection
18.Write a java 8 program to print employee details working in each department
19.Write a java 8 program to print max salary of employee in each department max/min employee salary in given collection
21.Write a Java 8 method to find the sum of all elements in a List of integers.



#Spring & Dependency Injection

They asked what designpatterns I am using in my project. Then questions moved to Dependency Injection what it is and different ways to inject beans in Spring. They also asked which injection is recommended and why.
I was asked about the bean life cycle, bean scopes, and the default bean scope.
They also asked the difference between ApplicationContext and Spring Context, and what the @Configuration annotation is.

hashtag#Microservices & Communication

Questions were asked on how microservices communicate with each other.
They asked about RestTemplate and WebClient.
They also asked if I know about Feign Client and why it is not recommended for production use in some cases.

hashtag#CoreJava & hashtag#Multithreading

From core Java, they asked about the volatile keyword.
Then questions on multithreading like how to create a thread and whether I have created threads in my project.
Here the discussion was more around the idea that in real production applications, we usually don't create threads manually.

hashtag#Collections & Data Structures

They asked about the internal working of HashMap.
Difference between Collection and Collections was also asked.

hashtag#Coding Questions

I was asked to write a program to count character frequency and print it in ascending order.
Another program was to print all substrings of a given string.

SQL

At the end, they asked a basic SQL query related to data retrieval.
Overall, the interview focused more on fundamentals, real project usage, and approach to problem-solving rather than just theory.
